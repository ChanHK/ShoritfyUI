# ShortifyUI

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build a simple user interface (UI) by consuming a microservice API. It utilizes the Next.js framework, Bootstrap for styling, and Redux for state management. The UI interacts with the microservice API to perform CRUD operations and display data to the user.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering and building web applications.
- Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework for responsive and mobile-first web development.
- Redux: A predictable state container for managing application state.
- Microservice API: A backend API providing data and functionality to the UI. Available at (`https://github.com/ChanHK/Shortify`)
